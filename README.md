# Java Console Task Manager

A simple console-based Task Manager application built using **Core Java**.

This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, **file handling**, and **basic data persistence** without using any external frameworks.

## 📌 About the Project

The Java Console Task Manager allows users to manage daily tasks through a command-line interface.

Users can:
- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

Task data is stored locally using **Java object serialization**, ensuring persistence even after restarting the application.

This project was built to strengthen understanding of **Core Java fundamentals and backend logic**.
