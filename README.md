# Java Console Task Manager

A simple console-based Task Manager application built using **Core Java**.

This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, **file handling**, and **basic data persistence** without using any external frameworks.

---

## 📌 About the Project

The Java Console Task Manager allows users to manage daily tasks through a command-line interface.

Users can:
- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks

Task data is stored locally using **Java object serialization**, ensuring persistence even after restarting the application.

This project was built to strengthen understanding of **Core Java fundamentals and backend logic**.

- View all existing tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks by task ID
- Persistent storage using file serialization
- Simple and user-friendly console menu

## Base Repository State

The current `main` branch represents the base repository state used as the foundation for defining and evaluating Task T1.

## Task T1: Fix Task ID Reset Issue
### Problem?
Right now, every time the application is restarted, task IDs start again from 1.  

### What should it do?
- Task IDs should continue increasing even after the application is restarted.
- If tasks already exist in the saved file, the next new task should get the next available ID.

### Expected result
After this change, restarting the application should not reset task IDs.  
Each task should always have a unique ID.
